Before you proceed, please remove any other shaders installations that you may have installed.

If it is not working as intended, try this:
1. Navigate to the Roblox installation directory (%UserProfile%\AppData\Local, then delete the Roblox folder and reinstall).
2. Run the setup file once more. It should solve your problem in most cases.
